# DoxyWorx

DISCLAIMER; A PROOF Of CONCEPT, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION YET.

DoxyWorx is a decentralized document workflow management system. DoxyWorx aims to be zero footprint, any one should be able to start a decentralized workflow, in collaboration with others not necessarily from same organization nor having similar software or blockchain knowledge.
 
DoxyWorx is built on polkadot, it has components to;
    - model, deploy and monitor workflow
    - integrate with web 2.0 / web 3.0 document apps;
        -- enable user to model workflow, assign roles, and deploy within the app
        -- enable user to see document progress done from multiple different front ends
    - integrates with code based smart contracts, like solidity, smart contract can be assigned to roles to fill in data in the document, or query if and what data have been filled for other steps.
    - Next Step, a pallet that executes business process models

Roadmap
TODO

## typical usage scenario;

open enabled document; e.g; google sheet;
open workflow modeler; model workflow;
    select cell;
    double click process task to assign account to fill that cell.
    deploy
    assigned accounts get notifications,
    each account open document, make copy, enter data on cell assigned to him; in order; and mark step done
    a smart contract can check if a specific data entered for step; for example; to release an escrow

Future work, enable option for users to fill in data without transaction fees, hence to prior balance

Target is to have a zero footprint. Any person with no prior blockchain specific knowledge nor special software, can use blockchain to develop and execute decentralized Application, and be used be similar audience.
